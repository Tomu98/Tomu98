<h3 align="left">About me</h3>

###

<p align="left">Hi, I'm Abel Tomás, I'm 25 years old and my goal is to be a professional software developer. I'm currently looking for my first work experience in Backend development, although I also have knowledge in Frontend and Machine Learning. I discovered programming in my teenage years through an inspiring video, but I started learning later, when I could have my computer.<br><br>Before getting into software development, I worked for several years in non-specialized roles, as a cashier and in an insurance office, which gave me valuable work experience and transferable skills. I discovered programming in my teens and, although I started learning later due to various difficulties, I have focused on software development. I am looking for my first professional experience in Backend development that will allow me to get ahead, help my family and with that achieve my dreams in this life.</p>
